    <h1>Weekly B</h1>
    <h3>Saturday, January 28th 2023</h3>
    <p>
        This weel we learned about how to link several HTML pages together using the a tag 
        <a href="./likethis.html">like this</a>
        This can be useful for when I am making a website and want it to have interactive buttons with several pages. I am excited about the Hypertext exercise 
        and am still thinking about how i want to stucture it. Right now I'm making it an "About Me" page that will go into two of my hobbies and my major. 
        I'm still thinking about how I can make the pages seem more fun to go through. The examples shown for this exercise really helped me start to figure out how I want to
        structure this assignment. Although it say no CSS right now, I'm thinking I might add CSS later so for my portfolio. I'm excited to be learning more about HTML and CSS 
        since many of the internships I'm looking into right now prefer candiates with some HTML and CSS knowledge. The Five Variations exercise 
        also looks intersting. I especially enjoyed Theresa Castellucci's site that showcased this exercise. I'm excited to start using more CSS for 
        ths exercise. <br> Something that I was struggling with last week was being able to change the font to the ones I picked out. I originally had two
        specific font picked out and then had the backup as sans serif. However, when I opened it in the live server it automattically defaulted to the sans
        serif typface. Im wondering what I can do to make the brower show my picked out fonts, or if the live server is just unable to show speacial fonts.
        Overall, this week was a mix of refresher and learning something new! I am very excited to see where the next week leads me.
