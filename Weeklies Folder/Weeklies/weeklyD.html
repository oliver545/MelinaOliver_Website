    <h1>Weekly D</h1>
   <h3> February 10, 2023</h3>
   
    <p>
        This week we presented our website designs and had studio time to get started on Project 1. I felt super inspired by everyone else's inspiration websites and their plans! 
        I planned for mine to be more of a standard portfolio that I can show future employers. 
        After seeing everyone else's ideas I'm thinking about keeping my original design and then having separate pages that the user could click on to try out different experiences. 
        I want to create something that is interactive and makes the user want to click around. Here are some changes I'm thinking about:
        <ul>
            <li>turning the boxes for the pages into fun shapes</li>
            <li>turning the boxes into "portals" that are interactive spheres, maybe they turn when the mouse hovers over them?</li>
        </ul>
        Pages ideas to explore:
        <ul>
            <li>make a small clicking game</li>
            <li>make something that the user must navigate using their arrow keys</li>
            <li>make something that full of interesting things that happen when the user scrolls</li>
        </ul>
        I want to include some more of the fun stuff that I saw from my inspiration websites. Right now I need to figure out how to change the font to something more interesting. I also need to figure out how I'm going to add the page images within my "work" section. Another thing is I want to figure out how to make a smooth transition between the main landing page and the "work" section of my page. Lastly, I want my main landing page to take up the entire screen no matter what device it is on. I originally was using pixel dimensions to define the space, but the page needs to be flexible for other devices, therefore defining pixels will not work forever.
