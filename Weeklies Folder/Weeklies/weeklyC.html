    <p>
        This week we went over excecise 1 & 2 in class. 
        After going over the excersies I am inspired to explore more things i can do with CSS. 
        I also think I would like to go back and add CSS to my excerise 1. The other thing I wanted to do was create was a story that used a tags.
        I saw a couple people did click and point stories which inspired me. Im taking a game design class right now too
        and think that I could combine the conent im learning in my game design class with the exercise 1. <br>
        Another class that I'm yaking right now is a Collab deisng class with all three deisng majors (Visual Communication, Interior, Industrial). This class is exploring
        the future of technology, how to try to predict what technology will succeed, and exploring how to use new technology.
        I'm hopeing that I can use the skills that I learn in this class to my collab class. The professor mentioned at the beggining of the clss that we couold have the opporitunity
        to explore areas on the internet/ new tech so I'm hoping that I will have the chance to use some HTML/CSS for one of the furutre projects. <br>
        Some random things that are happening in my life is I'm starting to play Minecraft again. I got inspired by some cool builds that have popped up on
        my tiktok and whated to try playing again with the intent being to build a cool house or town. <br> 
        Lastly, I'm really excited about building a portfolio page. TYhis is somthing I have been wanting to do for awhile and I found many sites that I am inspired by. 
        I hope to be able to build a site that is shows my aestheic and my html/css skills for my portfolio.
